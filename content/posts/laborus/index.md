## Features

* Jobs in Minecraft
* reward the placing and destroying of Blocks, the using of items and the killing and taming of mobs
* Job Abilities that eg. allow you to destroy blocks faster for 3 minutes every two hours
* anti replace farming system that blocks the rewarding of the placing and destroying of blocks on the same spot so the economy isn't as easily exploitable
* only allow doing the actions (eg. destroying of a block) after a specific level
* Job Boni like special or multiple drops or repairing of items
* completely configurable and translatable

A full lists of all possible actions, boni and abilities can be found in the Configuration section.

## How to use
To use this plugin you need a [Sponge](https://spongepowered.org) Server that is supporting the SpongeApi Version 5.2.
If you have a Server like this you only need to place the pluginfile into the mods folder.
When you have done this and you have started the server the default configuration file will automatically be added, but you still need to add the jobs you want to have to this file due to the missing of jobs in the default configuration.
Some ready configuration files with some jobs can be found in the [Configuration Cookbook in the Github repository](https://github.com/Lergin/Laborus/tree/master/ConfigurationCookbook). These files can just be used to replace the automatically created config and will get all missing configuration keys after the next stop of the server.
