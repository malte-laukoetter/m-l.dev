Hive Stats and Leaderboards is the most comprehensive website for statistics about The Hive. It provides rankings about who has the most [gold medals](https://hive.lergin.de/rankings/medals), [points](https://hive.lergin.de/rankings/points), [achievements](https://hive.lergin.de/rankings/achievements) and [many more](https://hive.lergin.de/rankings). We also track the points of players through the time for all the different gamemodes and provide more information than the The Hive profile page. Furthermore, we have [historic leaderboards](https://hive.lergin.de/leaderboards) for the different gamemodes and support comparing these. This website also has a [list of changes in the team of The Hive](https://hive.lergin.de/team) and a [list of all the maps](https://hive.lergin.de/maps). There are also statistics about the [unique players of the server and the gamemodes](https://hive.lergin.de/server).
